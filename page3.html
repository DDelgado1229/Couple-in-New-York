   <p style="color: blue;">Now that the couple has taken a closer look at the boroughs, and thanks to you have narrowed down their search, which boruough would be most fitting. <b>Manhattan</b>, closer to work and the essence of NYC although more expenisve it would be easy to have the "typical" New York experience here. Or <b>The Bronx</b>, cheaper than most areas sometimes for the worse. The Bronx offers an extremely cultured experience. A nice secluded area in The Bronx can offerr a beautiful piece of land and easy access to the hustle of city life.</p>
